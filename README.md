Ghidra
======

Let's build me!

# How to build

Instructions pretty simple.

```
cd Ghidra
mvn package
```

There assumption that root of this repository is same as root of unpacked Ghidra distribution. This allow magic to happens. 
I need more time to put all supplementary code to the source control and generate proper build pipeline.
